# smashfortressvscript

that one time when i tried to make a vscript gamemode for the first time (i suck at it)

Credits:
spoon - The smash bros vscript adaptation

LizardOfOz - VSH vscript creator that inspired me and gave me some semblance of understanding vscript as theres a lot of stuff missing from vscript's documentation that i got very confused on until i studied his work

Yakibomb - give_tf_weapon library
